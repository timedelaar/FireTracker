## FireTrackers - Semester Project

This fire tracking solution aims at recognizing the occurrence of a fire by measuring temperature and CO2 levels. Additionally, the usage of an infrared sensor allows recognizing whether people are in a certain room or not. This information is combined with a path finding algorithm to compute the safest and fastest way out of the Gwanggaeto – Gwan building at the Sejong University. 
The project is based on the oneM2M standard using Mobius 2.0 as a central sever and node.js, &Cube Thyme as well as TAS on a RaspberryPi that is connected to the corresponding sensors. Moreover, LEDs are used to physically indicate whether a path in the building is safe or not.
The frontend is based on React.js with Webpack, Babel  and ESLint.
